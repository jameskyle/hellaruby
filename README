HellaRuby is a Merb front end to the hellanzb daemon. 

**IMPORTANT**
This software, as usual, is offered with no guarantee of fitness of purpose 
or warranty. If your computer starts smoking, your house burns down, or 
all small children in the neighborhood go mysteriously missing, I don't want
to hear about it. 

However,  if you find any bugs, want any new features, or maybe added something 
very cool I'd be more then happy to work on them as time permits. Just shoot me 
an email or you can find me on irc.freenode.net #macosx under the nick krunk- 
(or variations) most of the time. 

This application was not designed for 'open to the world' use. It does direct writes
and deletes from your file system. It was designed as a nice front end for
a private network or on your personal computer (firewalled or behind a router).

For remote access, I usually use ssh tunneling. 

This is the first release and as such has only been tested on my personal system
and not in a hugely varied enviroment. Everything works fine for me. 

IF YOU ARE PARANOID, RUN UNDER A LIMITED USER WHO ONLY HAS READ/WRITE PERMISSIONS
TO THE HELLANZB DIRECTORIES!!


**INSTALLATION**
Please see INSTALL file for details on getting up and running.

**FEATURES**
Some of the features include:

* Real time download progress meter
* Upload nzb's from your computer to hellanzb
* Fetch nzb's using an nzb url
* Fetch nzb's using Newzbin MSGID's
* Real time hellanzb stats updating
* Real time updates of current file being processed
* Real time updates of the hellanzb queue
* Ability to manage queued nzbs
  - Move up, down, or delete from queue
* Full management of hellanzb such as pausing, clearing queue, cancel downloads, etc.
* List downloaded files, download them, delete them when not needed anymore
* Will tar up any directories for easy downloading (such as VIDEO_TS files) 
  after hellanzb is done processing. Ignores non-directories
* If a nzb fails, it will create a directory appended with nzbname_FAILED

As mentioned, this is just a front end. All these great features and more
primarily rest in hellanzb iteslf. Quite possibly God's best gift to usenet
addicts the world over. 

You can find out more about this great application without which this little 
front end would be completely useless at the Hellanzb Trac:
