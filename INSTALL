These installation instructions may be slanted toward an OSX environment,
but should work for any *nix like platform equally well.

1. Install and setup Hellanzb: http://www.hellanzb.com/trac/

2. Install ruby and the necessary gems. OSX will have ruby installed by default:
   *paranthesis mark the version I've tested against*

    - Ruby (1.8.6 patchlevel 111)
    - Merb (0.9.3)
    - merb-assets (0.9.3)
    - merb-has_flash (0.9.2)

That should be it. All other libs are part of the ruby stdlib

3. Edit the $application/config/init.rb file and fill in appropriate values for:
    - HELLA_URL="the url, user, password, and port that hellanzb is running on"
    - HELLA_BIN="/path/to/hellanzb.py"

4. Copy the $application/config/hellanzb.conf.example to 
   $application/config/hellanzb.conf  and configure to your desire. If you wish
   advantage of the post process tar'ing of directories and failed nzb marking
   go to the last line of the hellanzb.conf file, uncomment:
   
   Hellanzb.EXTERNAL_HANDLER_SCRIPT = '/path/to/hellaruby/scripts/tar_postprocess.rb'

   And replace the example path to that of the $application/scripts/tar_postprocess.rb 
   file.

5. Run the $applications/scripts/start_hellaruby script like so:
  
  scripts/start_hellaruby 5000

  Where 5000 is the port you want to run hellaruby on. If no port is given, 
  port 5000 is used.


*IMPORTANT*
  Hellaruby uses its own hellanzb.conf. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it
  is what the application expects. Hellaruby will automatically start hellanzb if
  necessary, but will not attempt to do so if it is already running. If you wish to 
  start hellanzb manually, it's probably best to do so using the 
  
  -c /path/to/hellaruby/config/hellanzb.conf 
  
  switch.
